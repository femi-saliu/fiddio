## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

## Problem ##
  > GitHub and Stack Overflow have helped transform programming from a solitary activity into a social movement; however, users still interact with lifeless code snippets when researching solutions or soliciting feedback. 

  > Video tutorials do a better job of addressing the issue of “connecting” people, but they must be accompanied with Plunkers or other linked/embedded code snippets for users to avoid having to pause and copy code from a video stream.

## Solution ##
  > To add richer layer of interaction to the concept of the code snippet, we propose combining the functionality of a SoundCloud audio file, with user comments plotted on the track’s duration, with Khan Academy’s live coding, video-like playback, which allows users to pause the stream and interact directly with the code as it stands at that point in time. 

  > Fidd.io allows users to pose questions as code snippets, for which other users can record explanatory audio tracks that sync to their live-coded solutions. Other users may then comment on the solution recordings, linking comments to the specific point in the audio track’s timeline.

  > Adding an audio component to code snippets lends feeling of connection and immediacy that greatly benefits aural learners, or just anyone who prefers to listen to spoken explanations to reading. The audio component also empowers programmers who struggle to convey complex ideas in writing; speaking the explanation in parallel with writing out the code saves time as it gives the respondent the chance to offer more details easily.
